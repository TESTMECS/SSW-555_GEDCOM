# Our Project for SSW 555 Agile Development. 
In this project we practiced Agile development through parsing GEDCOM family data, read more about the format here. [link](wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM)
Our parser used python to find errors and anomolies in the data. We answered user stories, completed tasks in sprints, and organized our efforts in weekly burndown charts and meetings.
